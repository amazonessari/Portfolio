# Background
The main purpose of the website is to penetrate the brand, so I designed it in a simple, elegant way according to their brand.

In this project, I tried SVG animation. You can specify an id or class name for child elements within an SVG tag in HTML. In figma, if you check "Include id Attribute" when you export, the group name will be added as id name, which is very convenient.
