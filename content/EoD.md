# Overview
When our affiliated company was launched, I created a corporate site to share the outline of the company. I did it with the web design tool STUDIO that allows you to create responsive static sites by dragg and dropp so that non-developers can edit it later.

# Team

## Fumiya Sorimachi
Mentor Designer - Gave me a feedback
## Takuya Shiomi
Director - Prepared contents


# Process
I organized the information based on the documents prepared by the client and visualized using diagrams and illustrations.

I paid the most attention to explaining the relationship by the size of characters and the distance between elements. I avoided long texts and broke down information.
