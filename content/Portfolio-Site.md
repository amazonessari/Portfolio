# Overview
It is my first portfolio website that I designed and coded entirely to show my work. Built by open-source static site generators HUGO.


# My role

## Research
Researched on award winners websites, HUGO, and JavaScript
## Wireframe
Made all the contents in Figma
## Design
Designed the static page in Figma
## Code
Coded in HTML, SCSS, and pure JavaScript with HUGO


# Process
I made this portfolio website to expand job opportunities with attaching to my resume. Thus I prioritized my works themself the most that cannot be conveyed in documents. Also, since I am neither experienced nor educated yet, it is my strategy to let you focus on what I have created.
