# Started from coding

I started learning coding on web services [Progate](https://progate.com/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) before design.

# Before internship
I have been into creativity in my entire life. When I was a little kid I used try to make anything from trash such as UFO catcher, a scale model and furniture.<br>
It comes to aesthetics when to create anything. Beautiful stuffs attract me a lot, but I thought it is a natural born talent and there is nothing I can do.
However I had a chance to learn design through employee referral the internship at Scoville.
These are the designs I have shown in the interview for internship at [scoville](https://sc0ville.com/) on 7th May, 2019

# In the internship
I worked on assignments from senior designer for several months.
I kept studying and designing with constantly giving presentation. I learned a lot from their feedback.
