# My background
I started customizing HTML/CSS at 12 years old for my diary blog. However, since I was too eager in it, my mom took the laptop away from me soon. Since then, I had not touched a computer.<br>
Meanwhile, I was dreaming to live abroad because I only grew up in a small town in Japan with seeing other cultures through media but no chance to travel. Finally, I made it to NewZealand and Australia for a long stay at 19 after saving up. <br>
While meeting travelers from many different backgrounds during the journey, creativity and flexibility of IT field fascinated me a lot.
I was pretty sure that I would love design and coding looking back on my childhood, so I decided to make a new career.

# In the beginning
First, I bought myself a laptop to learn to code in services called Progate and freeCodeCamp. Also, I attended meetup events weekly to fix bugs and develop together in Australia. Creativity excited me a lot, especially in designing.

Fortunately, I grabbed a chance to work as a designer intern at Scoville through employee referral.
These designs below are what I shared in the interview on the 7th of May, 2019.

# In the internship
For the first several months, I had worked on assignments of banner, logo, and LP design from a senior to know how to design logically. I  kept giving them my presentation step by step.
It contained my research, the progress, and the logic of my output. 
I researched anything to design stuff that makes sense.
That was a great practice, and I  learned thousands from their feedback.
