# Overview
MANOMA is a new smart home service provided by SONY.
Our company sells it targeting 20’s. I designed a flyer as product descriptions used in face-to-face sales.
I made it as my first design job with learning Illustrator and Photoshop. The reason why I came to design this flyer is because their original flyer did not have a hierarchy. We solved it by emphasizing the message "Switch easily at the low price".

On the front, it has the image of the device only plugged in as main to tell “easy”. The benefits are simply summarized into 3 on the bottom. On the other hand, on the back I have placed a frame of a pricing table supposed to be drew by the director, and an image in a scene in a living room to let audience imagine how to use Amazon Alexa specifically.

I made a great effort in the pricing table for the benefits to be remarkable. 
I designed various ideas based on director’s sketch, and I combined advantages of each as the final draft.
