# Overview

MANOMA is a new smart home service provided by SONY. It equips with Amazon Alexa to enable
voice control, and by inserting LTE SIM, you can easily have a wireless Internet environment without
any settings. Our company sells it targeting 20’s. I designed a flyer to be used for a product
description in face-to-face sales.

# Process

## Begin from an interview form
First of all, I have created a versatile, comprehensive interview form for future use in any design, since I
designed from scratch as my business for the first time. Moreover, I had meeting with the director of
MANOMA sales referring to existing media, after having specific phrases submitted, in order to ensure
that there is no difference in our image.
The main reason why I came to design was because the previous design did not have consistent
contents. Therefore, we decided to focus on the main appeal point “Switch cheap and easily".

## Sketch both on a paper and a screen
These are rough sketches I made based on the form that I received from the director.
On the front, it has the image of the device only plugged in as main to tell “easy”. The benefits are
simply summarized into 3 on the bottom. On the other hand, on the back I have placed a frame of a
pricing table supposed to be drew by the director, and an image in a scene in a living room to let
audience imagine how to use Amazon Alexa specifically.
I got a question here. How much details should I consider on a sketch? I reflected the better way : to
sketch without phrases on a paper and to move elements on a screen, in order to visualize many
ideas efficiently.

At first I took a lot of pictures based on the sketch on the front, but it didn't work very well, due to lack
of a professional look and an inconspicuous product. Thus, I ended up to process some assets in
Illustrator to realize the draft.
As a result we adopted a design with a plain color as a background to prioritize cheapness
considering our target audience.

## Pricing table with effort
Actually I found it the hardest to make a pricing table. It has to be plain and look good deal, but I
would not like to break the whole design as a designer. I made an effort especially to relate
“years”and”payment amount”, and to make “basic charge” inconspicuous.
I designed various ideas based on director’s sketch, and I combined advantages of each as the final
draft.

## Proper use of Photoshop and Illustrator
I edited some free images to match the whole design. I worked with learning how to use Photoshop,
because I was finally granted permission of Adobe Creative Cloud Complete Plan, although before
jumping on this project I had only used a trial of Illustrator.
Photoshop is raster-based and uses pixels to create images. It is the best for photo processing,
composition, illustration and drawing. In contrast, Illustrator works of vectors. These are points used
to create perfectly smooth lines which is the best for logo and layout.
Although I struggled when I faced different functions between Illustrator and Photoshop at first, I
became able to use them properly according to purposes. In this project I used Illustrator for the
whole design and edited elements in Photoshop if needed.

# Details

## Simple color palette

I tried to use as a few colors as possible to simplify it. In order to
maintain the MANOMA brand, I picked some colors used on their
official website and yellow for benefits in pricing table to catch eyes.

## Font DIN for numbers

While I was working with referring to a bunch of brochures and
flyers, I noticed common fonts among numbers in designs I like.
Thus I googled “price font”. I knew that font was called DIN.
DIN is a typeface originally designed for industrial uses. It is defined by the Germanstandards body DIN - Deutsches Institut für
Normung, widely used for traffic, administrative and technical
application. Due to the design's legibility and uncomplicated,
unadorned design, it has become popular for general purpose use
in signage and display
adaptations. That modern, geometric form perfectly suits
MANOMA.

Can you tell how important typefaces are through the images above?
In this project I picked Yu-gothic font used on the official website for Japanese, and DIN 2014 to let
prices stand out as well as to match the whole design.

## Create your original assets
Unfortunately there are not always assets that you would like to have in your project. Therefore I
challenged to take photos and to draw on software as described earlier in order to express an image
of a device only plugged in.
At last I could draw my ideal image with a photograph of the device, a free asset of an outlet, figures
and a path line. In this method, for example, you are able to adjust the outlet only, so that it will be
effective to take
the balance later.

# Conclusion
As I continued to modify such small details to submit many “last draft”s, I am satisfied with the really
last one. I learned a lot but it will take more effort to handle adobe software efficiently.
In this project I was working with a close client under the environment that we could discuss anytime.
However, it is not always so. I should ask detailed opinions until I get nothing to ask anymore, and
also set up a schedule practical for a designer.
I thank the director for giving me a kind praise, and I was happy to hear about other projects after
finishing all. I would keep going to great lengths for my best works.
